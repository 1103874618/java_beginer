Once there was a fish who lived in the great ocean, and because the water was transparent and always conveniently got out of the way of his nose when he moved along, he didn¡¯t know he was in the ocean. Well, one day the fish did a very dangerous thing, he began to think: ¡°Surely I am a most remarkable being, since I can move around like this in the middle of empty space.¡± Then the fish became confused because of thinking about moving and swimming, and he suddenly had an anxiety convulsion and thought he had forgotten how.
